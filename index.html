      There has always been a dog in my family since before I was born. Because
      of this I grew up to love them, and other pets such as cats as well. The
      love and affection you get from them is unparalled, let alone the
      incentive to exercise them, and yourself, in the process.

      Listening to music is always a calming experience for me. A good way to
      pass time without screens or other distractions. Im no professional, but
      singing along to your favorite song is an experience than even I can
      enjoy.

      My interest in vehicles is certaily an odd one. I didn't grow up with
      friends or family into them, it just sort of clicked. Even as young as two
      or three I just wanted to be around cars as much as possible, and that has
      not wayned ever since. My favorites include cars from;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ford</li>
      <li>Mercedes-Benz</li>
      <li>Porsche</li>
      <li>McLaren</li>
    </ul>
    <p>and more.</p>
